# context-revive

> Your side project died at 80%. Bring it back in one prompt.

Claude Code forgets your project halfway through long sessions.
Auto-compaction eats architectural context, old tokens fall out of
the window, the agent starts asking questions the README answered.

`context-revive` generates a dense, deterministic brief and
re-injects it into the session on a fixed cadence — the Anthropic
pattern called **structured note-taking**, wired through the
`UserPromptSubmit` hook.

One bash script. Zero runtime dependencies on the hot path — the
`refresh` hook calls only `bash` and `git`. No Python, no Node, no
compiled binary.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justi/context-revive/main/install.sh | bash
```

Requires:

- **Hot path (every refresh):** `bash`, `git`. Nothing else.
- **One-off setup:** `jq` for `revive install-hook`; `gh` is optional
  for best-quality PURPOSE extraction during `revive init`. Both are
  used once, never from the hook.

## Quick start

```bash
cd your-project
revive init              # scaffold .revive/static.md (PURPOSE auto-detected)
revive suggest | pbcopy  # optional — prompt for your agent to fill INVARIANTS/GOTCHAS
revive install-hook      # wire UserPromptSubmit into .claude/settings.json
revive show              # preview the brief
```

Every 5th prompt (or after 10 min / first call) Claude Code gets the
brief prepended to context — deterministic, <1800 chars, <100ms.

### Filling INVARIANTS and GOTCHAS with your agent

`revive init` gives you PURPOSE; INVARIANTS and GOTCHAS are the
human-curated sections (research shows auto-generation here hurts).
`revive suggest` prints a project-tailored LLM prompt you can paste
into Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, or any chat agent with file-read
access — it lists your actual CLAUDE.md / ADRs / HOT_FILES and asks
for 3-5 non-inferable rules. Paste the output into
`.revive/static.md` and you're done.

## Brief format

```
<revive refresh="N">
# STATIC  (rarely changes — edit by hand)
PURPOSE, INVARIANTS, GOTCHAS

# DYNAMIC (regenerated per refresh)
STATE      last 3 commits + active branch
TODO       first items from plan.md / TODO.md / ROADMAP.md
HOT_FILES  top 5 files by commit-frequency (last 20 commits)
COMMANDS   exact test/lint/build/dev scripts for this repo
</revive>
```

## Design — what goes in the brief, and why

2026 research on context engineering for coding agents converges on
one principle: **re-inject only what the agent can't re-derive from
code on its own.** We follow that evidence, section by section.

### What goes in (evidence-backed non-inferable facts)

- **PURPOSE** — a curated 1-liner. Extracted from a fallback chain:
  `gh repo view --json description` → `pyproject.toml` /
  `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `*.gemspec` / `composer.json`
  description → `CLAUDE.md` "What this project is" section →
  filtered README prose. First hit wins.
- **INVARIANTS** and **GOTCHAS** — user-edited. Research is blunt:
  *"Human curation yields ~4% performance gains; auto-generation
  reduces success rates by 0.5–2%"* ([Augment Code, 2026][augment]).
- **STATE** — current branch + last 3 commits. Pure `git` output,
  zero interpretation.
- **TODO** — first bullets from `plan.md` / `TODO.md` / `ROADMAP.md`.
  Again, whatever the repo already has.
- **HOT_FILES** — top 5 files by commit-frequency over the last 20
  commits, each annotated with the last commit subject that touched
  it. Framework-agnostic signal of "where work actually concentrates"
  (Rails `bin/kamal` / `bin/brakeman` scaffolding can't compete with
  files you keep reaching for).
- **COMMANDS** — exact invocations: `test:`, `lint:`, `build:`,
  `dev:`. Extracted from `package.json scripts` / `Makefile` /
  Rails `bin/*`, or overridden by `.revive/commands.md`. These are
  the canonical class of non-inferable facts an agent needs ([AGENTS.md
  guide, 2026][augment]).

### What we deliberately don't inject

- ❌ **Auto-generated architecture overview** — the Augment Code
  research on `AGENTS.md` is explicit: *"Directory trees cause stale
  structural references that mislead agents"*, and auto-generated
  overviews **reduce** agent success rate by 0.5–2% while increasing
  cost 20%+. If you want an architecture summary, write it by hand
  into `INVARIANTS` / `GOTCHAS`.
- ❌ **Directory tree / file listing** — same reasoning. The agent
  has `Glob` and `Read`. Any dump we inject goes stale the first
  time you move a file.
- ❌ **Dependency graph** — same class of stale-snapshot hazard.
- ❌ **Full file contents or patches** — blows the <1800-char budget;
  the agent has `Read` for the files `HOT_FILES` points to.
- ❌ **LLM-summarized anything** in the hot path. Zero-LLM by
  design — the brief must be deterministic and <100ms so the hook
  never stalls a prompt.

### Substrate / projection separation

Current 2026 consensus ([Zylos, 2026][zylos]) splits context into
a stable cacheable prefix and a fresh per-turn suffix. Our brief
maps cleanly: `STATIC` is the cacheable prefix (one human-curated
file per project), `DYNAMIC` is the fresh suffix regenerated every
emit.

### Refresh cadence

Emit every 5 prompts OR >10 minutes gap OR first call of the
session. This is complementary to Anthropic's AutoCompact (which
fires at context-window ceiling): we address **context rot** —
the agent forgetting as tokens drift out of attention — which
happens long before AutoCompact triggers.

## Why a shell script?

- **Zero runtime** — bash is on every dev machine.
- **<100ms cold start** — hot-path friendly.
- **Transparent** — `cat $(which revive)` and read it all.
- **One file to audit** — no dependency tree.

## Why not a longer CLAUDE.md?

CLAUDE.md loads once at session start. Sixty prompts later it's
compacted. `context-revive` refreshes on cadence so the brief stays
in the recent window where the agent actually attends.
